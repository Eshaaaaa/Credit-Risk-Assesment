# Credit Risk Assessment Project Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict credit risk for loan applicants. The goal is to help financial institutions make informed decisions about extending loans by predicting the likelihood of default based on customer data.

## Features
- Uses Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression to predict credit risk.
- Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation scores to identify the best performing algorithm.
- Provides visualizations to understand the relationship between customer features and credit risk.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive coding environment.
